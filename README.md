# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains a collection of machine learning assignments, each demonstrating a different algorithm or concept.

## Assignments

*   **Assignment 1: Multivariate Linear Regression**
    *   Predicts product sales based on advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
    *   Uses a closed-form linear regression model (normal equation).

*   **Assignment 2: Employee Attrition Prediction (KNN)**
    *   Predicts employee attrition using a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.
    *   Includes feature preprocessing (one-hot encoding, scaling).

*   **Assignment 3: Neural Network Diagram**
    *   Generates a diagram of a neural network for the Pima Indians Diabetes prediction problem.

*   **Assignment 4: 3D Plot for House Price Prediction**
    *   Visualizes a linear regression model for house price prediction in a 3D plot.

## How to Run

Each assignment is self-contained in its own directory and includes a `README.md` with specific instructions on how to run the code. Generally, you will need to:

1.  Navigate to the assignment directory (e.g., `cd Assignment1`).
2.  Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
3.  Run the Python script.
